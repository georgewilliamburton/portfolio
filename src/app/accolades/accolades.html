        George brings strong skills to the table and through his time with our Back office teams, 
        not only was a subject matter expert - delivering top notch customer service navigating  
        complex legacy billing systems - but also helped with up-skilling new team members and  
        providing SME support. He completed in charge leadership assignments and helped provide  
        feedback to deliver process improvements. It was a pleasure to work with George throughout  
        his time on the team and he’d be a valuable asset to any team.  <br>

        interaction we had together, he consistently demonstrated these qualities, making a  
        significant and positive impact on our team. George has a remarkable ability to connect  
        with customers, understand their needs, and provide exceptional service. His dedication  
        to customer satisfaction is evident in every interaction, and he consistently goes above  
        and beyond to ensure that clients feel valued and heard. As a coach and mentor, George  
        takes the time to understand everyone’s strengths and areas for improvement, he is patient, 
        approachable, and always willing to share his knowledge and expertise. George also 
        demonstrated great critical thinking skills, approaching challenges with a logical mindset, 
        anticipating potential obstacles, and proactively addressing them to ensure problems were  
        resolved efficiently and effectively. Working with George has always been a positive 
        experience! <br>

        I had the pleasure of working closely with George for more than 4 years, and during that
        time, I was able to observe him in two roles - Customer Solutions specialist and acting  
        Team Leader. As a CSS, George consistently met his KPIs, while ensuring he delivered a  
        great customer experience. He was also a SME, who was regularly leveraged as peer support.  
        As an acting Team leader, George was a natural, and he was able to hit the ground running 
        within his first few days. His team consistently delivered great results and they always 
        had great feedback to share about George. George's success in both roles can be attributed  
        to his strong skills and values. Specifically, George regularly demonstrated strong 
        communication, analytical, innovation, collaboration, negotiation, adaptability and 
        engagement skills. George is a well-rounded individual and there is no doubt that he would 
        be an asset to any organization! <br>
