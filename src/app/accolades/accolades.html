    <p>
        George brings strong skills to the table and through his time with our Back office teams, <br>
        not only was a subject matter expert - delivering top notch customer service navigating  <br>
        complex legacy billing systems - but also helped with up-skilling new team members and  <br>
        providing SME support. He completed in charge leadership assignments and helped provide  <br>
        feedback to deliver process improvements. It was a pleasure to work with George throughout  <br>
        his time on the team and he’d be a valuable asset to any team.  <br>

        George has excellent customer service, coaching, and problem-solving skills. In every <br>
        interaction we had together, he consistently demonstrated these qualities, making a  <br>
        significant and positive impact on our team. George has a remarkable ability to connect  <br>
        with customers, understand their needs, and provide exceptional service. His dedication  <br>
        to customer satisfaction is evident in every interaction, and he consistently goes above  <br>
        and beyond to ensure that clients feel valued and heard. As a coach and mentor, George  <br>
        takes the time to understand everyone’s strengths and areas for improvement, he is patient, <br>
        approachable, and always willing to share his knowledge and expertise. George also <br>
        demonstrated great critical thinking skills, approaching challenges with a logical mindset, <br>
        anticipating potential obstacles, and proactively addressing them to ensure problems were  <br>
        resolved efficiently and effectively. Working with George has always been a positive <br>
        experience! <br>

        I had the pleasure of working closely with George for more than 4 years, and during that<br>
        time, I was able to observe him in two roles - Customer Solutions specialist and acting  <br>
        Team Leader. As a CSS, George consistently met his KPIs, while ensuring he delivered a  <br>
        great customer experience. He was also a SME, who was regularly leveraged as peer support.  <br>
        As an acting Team leader, George was a natural, and he was able to hit the ground running <br>
        within his first few days. His team consistently delivered great results and they always <br>
        had great feedback to share about George. George's success in both roles can be attributed  <br>
        to his strong skills and values. Specifically, George regularly demonstrated strong <br>
        communication, analytical, innovation, collaboration, negotiation, adaptability and <br>
        engagement skills. George is a well-rounded individual and there is no doubt that he would <br>
        be an asset to any organization! <br>
