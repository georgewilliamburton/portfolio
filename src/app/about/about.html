        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        I am a father of three and a second-year <br>
        Software Development student at New Brunswick <br>
        Community College (NBCC) in Moncton. Before <br>
        starting this program, I was in the <br>
        telecommunications industry for close to <br>
        twenty years, where I developed a strong work <br>
        ethic, leadership and communication skills, and <br>
        learned how to work well in team environments. <br>
        These skills continue to support my progress as <br>
        a developer.<br>
